# new-eats-texas
This app scrapes a bunch of websites for new restaurants in Texas and outputs their respective locations on a map.
You will need to install the following packages before running the program: Folium, Geopy, and BeautifulSoup4.
First run the file houstonyelp.py to autogenerate a csv file. Then run map.py to autogenerate an html file.
Run the html file to see the new restaurants in your area.
